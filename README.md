# PointerAnalysis
Pointer analysis is a kind of program analysis - data flow analysis, responsible for finding out the pointees that a pointer points to at each program point. It helps in alias analysis, liveness analysis, constant propagation, dead code elimination. This is forward analysis. There are two flavours to it - may and must analysis, may is a superset of must. In the world of program analaysis, till date on flow and context insensitive analysis has been performed, due to scalability problems (undecidability). This is flow sensitive analysis and intra-procedural. The pass is implemented in LLVM.
